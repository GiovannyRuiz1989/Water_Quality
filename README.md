# Water_Quality
Welcome to the repository for my research project on water quality analysis in the estuary of Biscayne Bay, South Florida.
This project aims to assess and analyze the water quality dynamics using two-time series data. 
By studying the variations in key water quality parameters over time,
I aimed to gain insights into the health and condition of the estuarine ecosystem and try to create a predictive model.
You can find two files: The Python code I used to upload and analyze the data, and a Word document to resume my thought process
and the results of such an effort.
